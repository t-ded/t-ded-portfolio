      <description>Analysis of the relationship between diet and Covid-19 death rates - General EDA - Project Overview: Project Summary  Comprehensive data exploration and visualization including geographical analysis, which is something the author has never worked with before. This project may throw light on some of the most common misconceptions regarding diet as well as Covid-19 death rates, helping in fights against hoaxes and fake news. The analysis presented also enables us to compare some of the countries as well as continents and find some important patterns in terms of Covid-19 deaths, obesity and undernourishment.</description>

      <description>Analysis of more than 38 000 used cars and prediction of their price - Project Overview: Project Summary  Very complex exploration and visualization of the data, followed up by prediction of the target variable with R squared &amp;amp; adjusted R squared of 0.926 &amp;amp; 0.92. Implementation of Histogram Gradient Boosting algorithm as well as Linear Regression, including checks and violation-solutions of 4 key assumptions of linear regression. This analysis might bring a very strong use case, especially to an average person who would like to sell their car, but also to a company or a car market.</description>

      <description>Analysis of more than 19 thousand recruits of a data science company - Project Overview: Project Summary  Comprehensively explored and visualized the data, followed up by predicting the target variable with accuracy of 0.73. Engineered thousands of missing values based on the expected probability distribution of the feature. Implemented Classification Histogram Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest algorithms, extracted feature importance and performed feature selection. My findings might have a huge impact on the average time and money cost of new employees if implemented correctly into the recruiting system of a company in DS field.</description>

      <description>Analysis of more than 515 thousand reviews for European hotels - Project Overview: Project Summary  Comprehensively explored and visualized the data, followed up by predicting score given by the reviewer with RMSE of 0.73 points on 1-10 review scale. Engineered multiple features from the data, such as country of each hotel from address and length of stay from tags of each review. Performed sentiment analysis on text for each review, managed to find the most impactful pairs of words and how they affected the reviewer.</description>
