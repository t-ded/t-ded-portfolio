      <description>Analysis of more than 19 thousand recruits of a data science company - Project Overview: Project Summary  Comprehensively explored and visualized the data, followed up by predicting the target variable with accuracy of 0.73. Engineered thousands of missing values based on the expected probability distribution of the feature. Implemented Classification Histogram Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest algorithms, extracted feature importance and performed feature selection. My findings might have a huge impact on the average time and money cost of new employees if implemented correctly into the recruiting system of a company in DS field.</description>
